> Neighborhood event application

## Uses:

- NextJS ^14 (app router, server actions)
- Typescript (type checking )
- Shadcn (custom components)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Drizzle ORM (object relational mapping => communicate with DB)
- ZOD (validation)
- Tan Query (fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state)
- React Hook Form (form validation)
- Posthog (analytics)
- Vercel (CI/CD)
- Clerk (authentication)
- PostgreSQL (object relational database)

- [] style add event form
- [] setup server side analytics
- [] change favicon
- [] fix landing page image color issue in dark mode

## Issues:

- Need time picker that is customizable and works with shadcn, no time picker in shadcn
  â€¢ Created custom time selector from Shadcn select
- Need to read documentation covering several new technologies

# Current Issue

- events from db will show in all-events page with first logging in but once clicking submit on search for all events show no events found
